ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
======================
The React component is being unmounted and remounted immediately after the first load completes,
causing the viewer to be initialized twice. This is visible in the logs where we see:
- First complete initialization cycle (steps 1-6)
- Cleanup (steps 7-8)
- Second complete initialization cycle (steps 9-14)

The issue is likely in App.tsx where handleSelectModel uses setTimeout to set the model,
which may be causing React to mount/unmount the component multiple times.
